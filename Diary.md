This is an online repository for my coding final homework where I'll submit and update.
This project shall thank https://github.com/nagadomi/lbpcascade_animeface which provides sooo many ideas.

	I suddenly realized that I could update this Diary.md to record my progress with words.
	An accident happened. I accidentally restore some of my codes and commit and push them to github. Luckily, I found that in time and find data back with Pycharm.
